	<h4>Tales of Arthur</h4>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Chapter 1</li>	
		<p>Once there was a young boy named Arthur McKillucuty. He had a special gift, magic. This was an especially unique gift because he lived in on a planet and in an age of spacecraft and machines. But he did not know it at the time. Until one day, in the city of Burland, he was rushing headlong to the spacecraft assembly site. He was late for his job which he put monumental effort into achieving. He, luckily, arrived on time. As the signal bell rang, he and the rest of his co-workers assembled to hear their employer’s address.
 
As the big man walked onto a platform hanging above all their heads, Arthur decided to remind himself whom he was working for. The man on the platform, his employer, was Otto Von Raumschiff, one of the most rich and powerful men in the galaxy. His wealth allowed him a position on the grand council of Verena, which was the galactic dominion Arthur lived in. Otto was also a great supporter of spacecraft. His constant pushing for the construction of more spacecraft resulted in projects such as these, which would yield many trade and war vessels for Verena. Otto tapped the microphone which snapped Arthur back to reality. Raumshiff cleared his throat and started to speak. His voice was slightly low and pleasing to listen to. He said “I welcome you all here today, to begin work on the newest frigate in our fleet, the Stern Falke. This vessel will help us greatly in getting a leg up on those Viradel bastards!”. His remark got several cheers and whistles, as Viradel was a hated rival of Verena. Otto continued his oration, “I desire for you all to work diligently, for this is a matter of the utmost importance to me and to the rest of our fair nation”. More cheers. “And once it is complete, not only will you all be rewarded” Otto continued “but a select few will be allowed the honor of being part of her crew”. This received the most enthusiastic cheer of all, as serving on a military vessel was one of the most prestigious and coveted jobs in the galaxy. Arthur found himself hoping he would end up being one of the lucky few. He and the rest of the workers got readily to work when it happened. Six hours into the work, Arthur stopped for a break. He took a drink of water and looked around. The city of Burland was as beautiful as ever. The buildings were all glittering spires of glass and steel, the land around them was covered with the healthiest green grass and sand white sidewalks. There were no roads as all the cars could fly through the air. The sky was full of clouds, although the sun peeked through often. As Arthur looked around his gaze fell onto the scaffolding around the starship. A cloud had covered the sun, and the surroundings had become darker than before. And then he saw it. On the scaffolding sat a dark figure. It looked to be entirely black, and was scratching at the hull of the ship. Arthur started to yell “Hey what are y--”, when the spaceship exploded. Arthur was flung to the edge of the site. As he slowly lost consciousness, he heard yells and fire. Then it all went black. </p>
	
	<li>Chapter 2</li>
		<p>After a while, he began to dream. He was in what seemed to be an abstract painting of a hill, with some kind of old ruins on it, and a single large, dead, tree. He was near the tree, facing away from it. He could not see far from the hill, as it seemed to be cut off by a wall of fog or clouds. Out of this fog stepped a figure similar to the one at the construction site. It was not human, its limbs were very thin and longer than a human’s, its legs ended in sharp points and there were no feet. Its torso was almost rectangular, hidden under a long black coat. Its skin was ink black, and where its face would have been there was what looked like a mask. The only features on it were thin curved eyes that were only red and had no pupil or iris. Its “face” also sported a mouth, which was also red, thin and was in a smile that stretched to either side of it’s “face”. It walked towards him, and looked at him. Then it spoke. “Well, that went well didn’t it?” it said. It’s voice sounded like as if it came from underwater, but was clear and understandable despite this. It continued, “Seems you flew about 50 meters and landed on your head, I believe you would be in a hospital right now”. Arthur noticed that its body seemed to slightly shift and move slightly, almost unnoticeably. He ,however, could not move or speak. The being continued on, “I suppose you want to know what happened?”, a pause, “Let me tell you”. It squatted down, and raised its head to look at him. “You were injured due to the actions of one of my bodies. It was trying to find its way into the ship to talk to you discreetly but it chose a bad spot to do it”. The creature shook its head. “I do have difficulty making my extensions act smartly when I have many to control, but no matter, I suppose I can talk to you now”. Its head twitched a little. “The reason I’m contacting you is to congratulate you on your newfound powers”. Arthur did not understand what it was talking about. What powers? The being seemed to read his mind and said “The powers I am referring to are best described as Magic”. Arthur would have started if he could move. Instead he racked his memory for what Magic was. He remembered that it was something humans used long ago, and that it had been lost long ago, and that many galactic nations were trying to find it. The creature spoke “Yes it still exists, and you’ve got it!” it laughed an unnerving laugh and continued “But time is short, you’ll wake soon, so I need to tell you what to do: Make sure that when you wake up, you find a way to get on a spaceship. I don’t care how you do it, whether you join the navy or do it on your own, it’s up to you”. It stood upright and finished its lecture “Keep that in mind, once you accomplish it, you’ll see me again”. The dream world faded away and Arthur heard someone calling his name. He opened his eyes and saw Otto Raumshiff looking at him. Arthur was in a healing tank, suspended in greenish liquid. From behind the glass, Otto and several doctors were looking at him. He waved his hand at them and they burst into action. The doctors ran to machines beside the healing tank and began to fiddle with the controls furiously. Otto stood back and crossed his hands behind his back. The liquid drained from the tank, and the door opened and Arthur shakily stepped outside. Doctors dressed him in a white robe and Otto said “Good to have you back son, now let’s get you to a bed”.</p>
	
	<li>Chapter 3</li>
		<p>The next few hours consisted of wires and questions for Arthur. He told them what he saw before the explosion, but kept quiet about his dream. After all that, Otto declared that it was probably a covert attack by Viradel agents, and closed the matter. He promised Arthur his pay, and a bonus for his witness account of the events and departed. The doctors released Arthur a few hours later. So Arthur was on the street, fully recovered, and 5,000 credits richer. He had no chance of being part of the Stern Flake’s crew, since it exploded. Arthur remembered the creature’s words, to find a ship and go out into space. He decided to do just that, since he had nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. So he went to the cosmo-docks and decided to find himself a ship. Several days searching, and he found himself a ship. It was an old exploration ship, practically ancient, it’s owner an old explorer living out the rest of his days. It cost Arthur all his money, but he decided it was worth it. In fact it was a pretty good deal for a starship. The name of the ship was the Million Falcon. Shaped like a carrot, it was the color of brass. Four fins protruded from its tail end. It had a window. The technology on the ship was old and the the computer’s code was an old one, but it checked out. The upside was that everything was nicely furnished. It was made of leather and wood and was nicely furnished. Arthur sat down and thought “Now, time to see what the future has in store for me”, and pushed the start button.</p>
	<li>Chapter 4</li>
		<p>When he did this, he found a downside to the ship. It had no seatbelts. After a harrowing trip through the atmosphere the ship stopped shaking. Luckily, the ship did have oxygen. Arthur sailed past the moon of solitude, a short distance from his home planet, his ship went dark. All the lights went out, and the computer screens went black. Then, two round red eyes and a red crescent of a mouth appeared on them. He heard the creature’s voice, “So, you got yourself a ship… of a sort”. Arthur replied “Yes, like you said” slightly hurt by the creatures tone. It replied “No matter, we have time to improve it later, at the present, I wish to introduce myself”. It paused, then it continued “I am  Mr. Unodoli, and I work for the Pila Fulgur organization, and I am here to acquire your services”. Arthur thought and said “I’ve never heard of you”. Unodoli replied “I should hope not, we try not to let people know about our operations”
“So then, what is it you do?”
“We are something like… mercenary… pirate… people.”
“Oh”
Unodoli regarded Arthur and then continued, “So, will you cooperate with us?”
“Sure, I will cooperate with you, but what is in it for me?”
“Well you will get paid nicely and you will learn and develop great powers”
“What great powers?”
“Don’t worry about that now i will tell you more later”
“Anyway for now travel to the planet Pompiss, it is a rich planet with vast land and many beautiful cities, once you get there find a man named Crimgo and find his vault, then from his vault, steal a chip which has a map of the universe on it. You can also take anything else you want from it. And you can do whatever you want with Crimgo just make sure to get the map. After you get it we will give you further instructions.”
Arthur set of on his flight to Pompiss. After a few days of flying he finally made it to Pompiss. As he was landing he was amazed by the beautiful city and almost crashed. When he got off his ship he wandered around the city going into bars, taverns, hotels, casinos, and business buildings trying to find out where he could find Crimgo and who he was. After hours of long, tiring, and tedious searching he finally found someone who knew where to find Crimgo. Arthur found out that Crimgo lived on 25 May street. Arthur rushed over to Crimgo’s house and camped there until night fell. After the sun set, Arthur snuck into Crimgo’s house through the living room window. As he snuck up the stairs on his tiptoes, trying not to make any noise, to Crimgos bedroom where he was sleeping he noticed a bunch of dots on the walls in the hallway at the top of the stairs and he realized  that they were lasers. “ Nice security system” Arthur thought to himself. He sighed and, through “impossible feats of acrobatics” wiggled his way past the lasers. Finally he made it to Crimgo’s bedroom door. Arthur quietly opened the door and snuck over to the snoring Crimgo. Arthur got a rope out of his bag, which he purchased earlier, and carefully and slowly tied it around Crimgo’s legs. After that he tied the rope to a hook on the ceiling and pulled, which made Crimgo dangle upside down. Then after a few minutes of trying Arthur made Crimgo wake up. “AAAAAHHHHHH! Who are you!?“ yelled Crimgo.
“That does not matter, What does matter is that I want to know where your vault is. And after you tell me I will proceed to open it, and if you do not tell me, I will go to extreme lengths to get it out of you” Crimgo audibly gulped. “I will never tell you where my vault is”
“Well then I will have to persuade until you tell me”
As Arthur reeled back with his fist Crimgo immediately started to plead “Fine! fine! I will tell you where my vault is just please don't hurt me”
“So where is it?”
“It is in my basement, you have to go to the bookshelf and pull on the Game of Chairs book and the bookshelf will slide away revealing my vault, the code to open my vault is 9873021” Arthur un-tied Crimgo and let him drop to the ground where he passed out. Arthur proceed to the basement where he found the Game of Chairs book and pulled it which then uncovered  the vault’s door and he typed the code in. The vault door opened with a loud creak and inside were mountains of gold and other riches and in the center was a pedestal with a chip, which probably had the map on it. So Arthur proceed to stuff his bag with riches and gold. After he stuffed his bag to the brim he took the chip off the pedestal and ran out of the building and sprinted back to his ship.
