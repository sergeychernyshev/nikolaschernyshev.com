	<h4>Tales of Arthur</h4>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Chapter 1</li>	
		<p>Once there was a young boy named Arthur McKillucuty. He had a special gift, magic. This was an especially unique gift because he lived in on a planet and in an age of spacecraft and machines. But he did not know it at the time. Until one day, in the city of Burland, he was rushing headlong to the spacecraft assembly site. He was late for his job which he put monumental effort into achieving. He, luckily, arrived on time. As the signal bell rang, he and the rest of his co-workers assembled to hear their employer’s address.
 
As the big man walked onto a platform hanging above all their heads, Arthur decided to remind himself whom he was working for. The man on the platform, his employer, was Otto Von Raumschiff, one of the most rich and powerful men in the galaxy. His wealth allowed him a position on the grand council of Verena, which was the galactic dominion Arthur lived in. Otto was also a great supporter of spacecraft. His constant pushing for the construction of more spacecraft resulted in projects such as these, which would yield many trade and war vessels for Verena. Otto tapped the microphone which snapped Arthur back to reality. Raumshiff cleared his throat and started to speak. His voice was slightly low and pleasing to listen to. He said “I welcome you all here today, to begin work on the newest frigate in our fleet, the Stern Falke. This vessel will help us greatly in getting a leg up on those Viradel bastards!”. His remark got several cheers and whistles, as Viradel was a hated rival of Verena. Otto continued his oration, “I desire for you all to work diligently, for this is a matter of the utmost importance to me and to the rest of our fair nation”. More cheers. “And once it is complete, not only will you all be rewarded” Otto continued “but a select few will be allowed the honor of being part of her crew”. This received the most enthusiastic cheer of all, as serving on a military vessel was one of the most prestigious and coveted jobs in the galaxy. Arthur found himself hoping he would end up being one of the lucky few. He and the rest of the workers got readily to work when it happened. Six hours into the work, Arthur stopped for a break. He took a drink of water and looked around. The city of Burland was as beautiful as ever. The buildings were all glittering spires of glass and steel, the land around them was covered with the healthiest green grass and sand white sidewalks. There were no roads as all the cars could fly through the air. The sky was full of clouds, although the sun peeked through often. As Arthur looked around his gaze fell onto the scaffolding around the starship. A cloud had covered the sun, and the surroundings had become darker than before. And then he saw it. On the scaffolding sat a dark figure. It looked to be entirely black, and was scratching at the hull of the ship. Arthur started to yell “Hey what are y--”, when the spaceship exploded. Arthur was flung to the edge of the site. As he slowly lost consciousness, he heard yells and fire. Then it all went black. </p>
