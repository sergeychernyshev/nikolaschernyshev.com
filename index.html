	<h4>Tales of Arthur</h4>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Chapter 1</li>	
		<p>Once there was a young boy named Arthur McKillucuty. He had a special gift, magic. This was an especially unique gift because he lived in on a planet and in an age of spacecraft and machines. But he did not know it at the time. Until one day, in the city of Burland, he was rushing headlong to the spacecraft assembly site. He was late for his job which he put monumental effort into achieving. He, luckily, arrived on time. As the signal bell rang, he and the rest of his co-workers assembled to hear their employer’s address.
 
As the big man walked onto a platform hanging above all their heads, Arthur decided to remind himself whom he was working for. The man on the platform, his employer, was Otto Von Raumschiff, one of the most rich and powerful men in the galaxy. His wealth allowed him a position on the grand council of Verena, which was the galactic dominion Arthur lived in. Otto was also a great supporter of spacecraft. His constant pushing for the construction of more spacecraft resulted in projects such as these, which would yield many trade and war vessels for Verena. Otto tapped the microphone which snapped Arthur back to reality. Raumshiff cleared his throat and started to speak. His voice was slightly low and pleasing to listen to. He said “I welcome you all here today, to begin work on the newest frigate in our fleet, the Stern Falke. This vessel will help us greatly in getting a leg up on those Viradel bastards!”. His remark got several cheers and whistles, as Viradel was a hated rival of Verena. Otto continued his oration, “I desire for you all to work diligently, for this is a matter of the utmost importance to me and to the rest of our fair nation”. More cheers. “And once it is complete, not only will you all be rewarded” Otto continued “but a select few will be allowed the honor of being part of her crew”. This received the most enthusiastic cheer of all, as serving on a military vessel was one of the most prestigious and coveted jobs in the galaxy. Arthur found himself hoping he would end up being one of the lucky few. He and the rest of the workers got readily to work when it happened. Six hours into the work, Arthur stopped for a break. He took a drink of water and looked around. The city of Burland was as beautiful as ever. The buildings were all glittering spires of glass and steel, the land around them was covered with the healthiest green grass and sand white sidewalks. There were no roads as all the cars could fly through the air. The sky was full of clouds, although the sun peeked through often. As Arthur looked around his gaze fell onto the scaffolding around the starship. A cloud had covered the sun, and the surroundings had become darker than before. And then he saw it. On the scaffolding sat a dark figure. It looked to be entirely black, and was scratching at the hull of the ship. Arthur started to yell “Hey what are y--”, when the spaceship exploded. Arthur was flung to the edge of the site. As he slowly lost consciousness, he heard yells and fire. Then it all went black. </p>
	
	<li>Chapter 2</li>
		<p>After a while, he began to dream. He was in what seemed to be an abstract painting of a hill, with some kind of old ruins on it, and a single large, dead, tree. He was near the tree, facing away from it. He could not see far from the hill, as it seemed to be cut off by a wall of fog or clouds. Out of this fog stepped a figure similar to the one at the construction site. It was not human, its limbs were very thin and longer than a human’s, its legs ended in sharp points and there were no feet. Its torso was almost rectangular, hidden under a long black coat. Its skin was ink black, and where its face would have been there was what looked like a mask. The only features on it were thin curved eyes that were only red and had no pupil or iris. Its “face” also sported a mouth, which was also red, thin and was in a smile that stretched to either side of it’s “face”. It walked towards him, and looked at him. Then it spoke. “Well, that went well didn’t it?” it said. It’s voice sounded like as if it came from underwater, but was clear and understandable despite this. It continued, “Seems you flew about 50 meters and landed on your head, I believe you would be in a hospital right now”. Arthur noticed that its body seemed to slightly shift and move slightly, almost unnoticeably. He ,however, could not move or speak. The being continued on, “I suppose you want to know what happened?”, a pause, “Let me tell you”. It squatted down, and raised its head to look at him. “You were injured due to the actions of one of my bodies. It was trying to find its way into the ship to talk to you discreetly but it chose a bad spot to do it”. The creature shook its head. “I do have difficulty making my extensions act smartly when I have many to control, but no matter, I suppose I can talk to you now”. Its head twitched a little. “The reason I’m contacting you is to congratulate you on your newfound powers”. Arthur did not understand what it was talking about. What powers? The being seemed to read his mind and said “The powers I am referring to are best described as Magic”. Arthur would have started if he could move. Instead he racked his memory for what Magic was. He remembered that it was something humans used long ago, and that it had been lost long ago, and that many galactic nations were trying to find it. The creature spoke “Yes it still exists, and you’ve got it!” it laughed an unnerving laugh and continued “But time is short, you’ll wake soon, so I need to tell you what to do: Make sure that when you wake up, you find a way to get on a spaceship. I don’t care how you do it, whether you join the navy or do it on your own, it’s up to you”. It stood upright and finished its lecture “Keep that in mind, once you accomplish it, you’ll see me again”. The dream world faded away and Arthur heard someone calling his name. He opened his eyes and saw Otto Raumshiff looking at him. Arthur was in a healing tank, suspended in greenish liquid. From behind the glass, Otto and several doctors were looking at him. He waved his hand at them and they burst into action. The doctors ran to machines beside the healing tank and began to fiddle with the controls furiously. Otto stood back and crossed his hands behind his back. The liquid drained from the tank, and the door opened and Arthur shakily stepped outside. Doctors dressed him in a white robe and Otto said “Good to have you back son, now let’s get you to a bed”.</p>
	
	<li>Chapter 3</li>
		<p>The next few hours consisted of wires and questions for Arthur. He told them what he saw before the explosion, but kept quiet about his dream. After all that, Otto declared that it was probably a covert attack by Viradel agents, and closed the matter. He promised Arthur his pay, and a bonus for his witness account of the events and departed. The doctors released Arthur a few hours later. So Arthur was on the street, fully recovered, and 5,000 credits richer. He had no chance of being part of the Stern Flake’s crew, since it exploded. Arthur remembered the creature’s words, to find a ship and go out into space. He decided to do just that, since he had nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. So he went to the cosmo-docks and decided to find himself a ship. Several days searching, and he found himself a ship. It was an old exploration ship, practically ancient, it’s owner an old explorer living out the rest of his days. It cost Arthur all his money, but he decided it was worth it. In fact it was a pretty good deal for a starship. The name of the ship was the Million Falcon. Shaped like a carrot, it was the color of brass. Four fins protruded from its tail end. It had a window. The technology on the ship was old and the the computer’s code was an old one, but it checked out. The upside was that everything was nicely furnished. It was made of leather and wood and was nicely furnished. Arthur sat down and thought “Now, time to see what the future has in store for me”, and pushed the start button.</p>
	<li>Chapter 4</li>
		<p>When he did this, he found a downside to the ship. It had no seatbelts. After a harrowing trip through the atmosphere the ship stopped shaking. Luckily, the ship did have oxygen. Arthur sailed past the moon of solitude, a short distance from his home planet, his ship went dark. All the lights went out, and the computer screens went black. Then, two round red eyes and a red crescent of a mouth appeared on them. He heard the creature’s voice, “So, you got yourself a ship… of a sort”. Arthur replied “Yes, like you said” slightly hurt by the creatures tone. It replied “No matter, we have time to improve it later, at the present, I wish to introduce myself”. It paused, then it continued “I am  Mr. Unodoli, and I work for the Pila Fulgur organization, and I am here to acquire your services”. Arthur thought and said “I’ve never heard of you”. Unodoli replied “I should hope not, we try not to let people know about our operations”
“So then, what is it you do?”
“We are something like… mercenary… pirate… people.”
“Oh”
Unodoli regarded Arthur and then continued, “So, will you cooperate with us?”
“Sure, I will cooperate with you, but what is in it for me?”
“Well you will get paid nicely and you will learn and develop great powers”
“What great powers?”
“Don’t worry about that now i will tell you more later”
“Anyway for now travel to the planet Pompiss, it is a rich planet with vast land and many beautiful cities, once you get there find a man named Crimgo and find his vault, then from his vault, steal a chip which has a map of the universe on it. You can also take anything else you want from it. And you can do whatever you want with Crimgo just make sure to get the map. After you get it we will give you further instructions.”
Arthur set of on his flight to Pompiss. After a few days of flying he finally made it to Pompiss. As he was landing he was amazed by the beautiful city and almost crashed. When he got off his ship he wandered around the city going into bars, taverns, hotels, casinos, and business buildings trying to find out where he could find Crimgo and who he was. After hours of long, tiring, and tedious searching he finally found someone who knew where to find Crimgo. Arthur found out that Crimgo lived on 25 May street. Arthur rushed over to Crimgo’s house and camped there until night fell. After the sun set, Arthur snuck into Crimgo’s house through the living room window. As he snuck up the stairs on his tiptoes, trying not to make any noise, to Crimgos bedroom where he was sleeping he noticed a bunch of dots on the walls in the hallway at the top of the stairs and he realized  that they were lasers. “ Nice security system” Arthur thought to himself. He sighed and, through “impossible feats of acrobatics” wiggled his way past the lasers. Finally he made it to Crimgo’s bedroom door. Arthur quietly opened the door and snuck over to the snoring Crimgo. Arthur got a rope out of his bag, which he purchased earlier, and carefully and slowly tied it around Crimgo’s legs. After that he tied the rope to a hook on the ceiling and pulled, which made Crimgo dangle upside down. Then after a few minutes of trying Arthur made Crimgo wake up. “AAAAAHHHHHH! Who are you!?“ yelled Crimgo.
“That does not matter, What does matter is that I want to know where your vault is. And after you tell me I will proceed to open it, and if you do not tell me, I will go to extreme lengths to get it out of you” Crimgo audibly gulped. “I will never tell you where my vault is”
“Well then I will have to persuade until you tell me”
As Arthur reeled back with his fist Crimgo immediately started to plead “Fine! fine! I will tell you where my vault is just please don't hurt me”
“So where is it?”
“It is in my basement, you have to go to the bookshelf and pull on the Game of Chairs book and the bookshelf will slide away revealing my vault, the code to open my vault is 9873021” Arthur un-tied Crimgo and let him drop to the ground where he passed out. Arthur proceed to the basement where he found the Game of Chairs book and pulled it which then uncovered  the vault’s door and he typed the code in. The vault door opened with a loud creak and inside were mountains of gold and other riches and in the center was a pedestal with a chip, which probably had the map on it. So Arthur proceed to stuff his bag with riches and gold. After he stuffed his bag to the brim he took the chip off the pedestal and ran out of the building and sprinted back to his ship.
</p>
	<li>Chapter 5</li>
		<p>As the Million Falcon sped towards the stars, a message arrived on the screen. “Ah, Arthur I see that you got the chip” “ Now that you know where every thing in the universe thanks to the map that is on this chip, your next mission will be is to locate and fly to the planet Evadamonda which is where our headquarters are located so you can start your training. Hope you have no troubles on your trip” After the message ended arthur started trying to locate Evadamonda on the map. After hours of searching and reading names of planets and scrolling and swiping he finally found Evadamonda. It was located in the Cigam Galaxy, way north of Pompiss. It would take him months maybe even years without a Hyper drive. A Hyperdrive was a drive that let the ship go at light speed, if Arthur obtained a drive like this he could get to Avdamonda in about 3 days. But it was hard to find these drives because they got banned on use of ships a few years back because new ship speed laws were put into effect. So Arthur set out to find a hyperdrive. In the next few weeks Arthur flew to many different planets, some richer than other, some bigger then others, some advanced than other. But then he went to this one planet that looked really shady. It was planet The Dooh, it was like the slums back at Arthur’s home planet. After Arthur landed on the dooh, he went out searching for a hyperdrive. After a few stores and dealers who did not have one, Arthur walked into this nice small clock shop. He assumed that a place this decent looking would not have a hyperdrive . But as he was about to leave he felt a hand grab his shoulder. He turned around and saw a short elderly woman. She was the owner of the shop. “I know why you are here” And she held out a hyper drive.
“How did you know” Arthur asked in amazement
“Nothing is a secret to those with the power of divination”
“So how much…”
“It is 7,000 credits” answered the lady before arthur could finish his sentence. This was too much for Arthur. He only had 2,500 credits. So after a few minutes of bargaining he got the price down to 2,000 credits and his golden belt buckle. After they exchanged items Arthur went back to his ship.  When he got into the ship he headed to the control room to put the drive in. Arthur sat onto the captain's chair and looked for the port into which he could put the hyper speed drive, but there wasn't one. So he started to look for the port. Arthur walked in circles around the same hallway for the first few minutes, but after realizing it he moved on to the rest of the ship. Another half hour or so passed and he finally found the port. It was in the back of the lower engine room. Arthur walked up to the port and slowly inserted the drive. The port sparked a little and the lights flashed on and off and a beeping cacophony rang through the ship. After everything calmed down and stopped making sound Arthur went back to the controller room and took off of the planet and went back into space.”It’s time to put this drive to the test” Arthur said as he pushed the button to activate the light speed drive. The whole ship began to shake. Boom! the ship shot forward. The stars were flying past the ship. Arthur melted into his seat from the G-force. After traveling a few galaxies over he turned the light speed off to get his breath back. After Arthur finally relaxed, he turned the map on and the light speed drive, and started heading toward Avdamonda. After four days of traveling at the speed of light  he finally made it to the Cigam galaxy. The next few hours he looked for Avdamonda. During these hours he saw many different planets. Some blue as can be , others huge, other tiny, and some abandoned. Finally Arthur stumbled upon Avdamonda . It was a yellowish ,greenish ,brownish color with dabs of blue in some spots. Arthur found the nearest landing port and landed. Right after his ship swiftly set on the ground he got another message. “Nice to see you again Arthur, I see that you have finally made it to our planet, I can’t wait to meet you in person.”
“Same here sir”
“Your next instruction is to find a tree with our symbol on it at 3:50 pm. There, at 4:00 o'clock sharp you will see a man in a cloak with our symbol on it. Our symbol is a circle with a face on it that is smiling, so look out for that man, he will lead you to our headquarters, hope to see you soon Arthur so we can begin your training”
“See you soon sir. Arthur out”
“Please don’t say that again”
After the message ended Arthur went and explored the ruins of a city just to pass time until 3:50. Arthur then accidentally dropped his canteen, and it rolled away.
</p>
		<li>Chapter 6</li>
		<p>He walked down the alley to pick up his canteen but then he got surrounded. There were six guys with baggy ripped clothing, bandanas, and  masks, all of them had knives.  They started closing in around Arthur with their knives pointed at him. “Give us all your money or you get stabbed” Said the guys. Arthur did not want to be stabbed or robbed so he picked up his canteen and chucked it at one of the guys’s heads. “Doing” and the guy fell over. All the other guys started to charge Arthur. He jumped up and stuck his legs out ot the sides. After doing that a couple time he was high up on the walls above they guys who started doing the same after him. Arthur  Then moved forward with his feet still pressed against the wall away from the guys climbing up to the guy he knocked out. Then he dropped down, grabbed the knife, and ran from the alleyway. All the guy dropped down after him  but they were clumsy and made a man pile. Arthur sprinted down the streets. After a couple abandoned houses he slowed down “ i think i lost them”. He continued walking. A Few hours later it was almost 3:00 so he decided to go look for the tree with the  symbol. Arthur walked to the edge of the city and the beginning of the forest. As arthur got deeper and deeper into the forest the harder it was to walk because there were a lot of thick spiky bushes everywhere. After walking for twenty minutes he made it to a clearing with a tree in the middle of it. He walked up to the tree and then walked around it. On the back side of the tree he found the symbol. It was 3:20, Because of that Arthur decided to rest until four. So he laid down and accidentally fell asleep. After 40 minutes it was four o’clock  and Arthur felt a hand on his shoulder, he jumped up and got out his knife and swung around rapidly like an idiot. Then all of a sudden he froze completely. He could not move his muscles. Then a man in a cloak with the symbol walked in front of him and unfroze him. “How did you do that?!”
“That is not important right now but you will learn soon”  
“Who are you”
“My name is Shivik , i am here to take you to the head quarters so you can begin your training.”
“I know i got the message, so let's go”
“Ok follow me”
Arthur started to follow Shivik deeper into the forest. The sun went down by the time they made it to another clearing with another tree. Shivik and arthur walked up to it and shivik reached for one of the branches and then pulled it down. Sounds of gears churning and turning spread throughout the forest like a fire. The tree started to spin down into the ground and stairs popped up from the sides of the hole the tree went down into. Shivik and arthur started to head down the steps. On the fifth step which had water on it arthur foot slid across the step making him lose balance and fall down into the hole. Then in mid air he stopped and floated up back towards the fifth stair. After arthur’s feet gently touched the stair he unfroze. “Thanks for saving my life ”
“No problem Arthur”
“How did you do that anyway”
“Like i said before that does not important right now and that you will learn soon” They continued down the stairs with no accidents ,at the bottom it was dark and cold.
</p>
		<li>Chapter 7</li>
		<p> Shivik Said some word that Arthur did not understand and then two metal doors lit up with green light and slid open. They stepped through the doorway into a long dark hallway. At the end of the hallway they went through another door way into a larger room that was the size of a train station. The lobby was filled with people in cloaks with the smiling face symbol. They made it through the groups of cloaked people to the other side of the room. Shivik said another set of words that Arthur did not understand and they went into an elevator. “Why couldn’t there be one of these at the entrance, so I did not have to fall to my death” complained Arthur.
 “Well the entrance was made long ago before the elevator was invented so we have stairs” explained Shivik.
“Can’t you just replace the stairs with an elevator”
“I have not thought of that, it’s a good idea, I will tell that to the chief”
“Where are you taking me anyway?” asked Arthur
“To see the chief” answered Shivik
Shivik pressed the button in the elevator that said chiefs floor. “Click” the elevator started to move up and the elevator music started to play. They finally got to the floor and the doors opened. They stepped out and went down the hallway into a room. The room was blue with large portraits hanging on the wall. At the end of the room there was a throne with a desk which a figure sat at. As they came closer to the figure Arthur saw that it was an old man who had a really long white beard and had a lot of wrinkles on his face and bags under his eyes.
“Hello Arthur, I am Al-Bin the chief of this Academy” said Al-Bin in a deep voice.
“What does this academy do?” asked Arthur
“We introduce and train people to their magical powers; you have to find it inside you and train, practice, and make it stronger” Explained AL-Bin
“What’s my power?”
“Well you will have to begin your training first. So sign up right hear”
Al-Bin put a long scroll that had a bunch of names on it. Arthur took the pen that was on the desk and signed his name.
“So When do I start?”
“The Training begins tomorrow”
Shivik and Arthur left the room. Shivik escorted Arthur to his living quarters.
“Here is your room,”
Then Shivik left. Arthur went into the room and took a look around. There was a levitating bed in the center, A desk in the corner. A bathroom, and a closet, and the walls and floor and ceiling where metal. Arthur left his room and went to explore the Academy. He found his way back to the lobby. In the center there was a big map of the whole Academy. There were so many different classrooms and there was a huge cafeteria. Then there where the living spaces, and a training facility. Also there was a teacher’s lounge and a mission control. After Remembering most of it Arthur went to the cafeteria. He asked for a ham sandwich and a bottle of
Poke-a-pola. He went up to the cashier
“That will be 20 credits”
Arthur took the credits out of his pocket and put it on the counter
“We don’t accept those credits we only accept credits from the bracelets you get when you start your training, which I see you have not started yet; sorry man”
“ Come on, please; I need to eat something so I can do well at the beginning of training tomorrow”.
“Fine, here, it’s on me”
“Thanks…” He looked at the name tag “Saso. Thank you so much”   
Arthur left the line and went and sat at one of the tables and started eating. Then a group of three cloaked people came over to him.
“Hey look at this new kid.” said a deep voice.
“Look at this loser he doesn’t even know his power yet” said the person next to the deep voice one.
“He does not have his robe yet” Said the person on the other side of the deep voice one.
“Who are you guys”
“None of your business, yet. But we will be if you mess with us and don’t give us all the credits you have” Said the one with the deep voice while raising his hand in a fist. Arthur gave them his 20 credits. Then the three guys left cackling evilly. Then a Girl that was wearing a striped shirt and jeans who had glasses, blue eyes, and brown hair came over.
“Hey, I saw what happened there, don’t let those guys push you around“ she said
“I probably looked really stupid”
“You kinda did.My name is Katelyn by the way”
“Nice to meet, my name is Arthur”
They shook hands and sat down at a table and continued to eat their food. After devouring their meals and chatting they went to their rooms which were surprisingly right next to each other. Arthur lay there in bed twisting and turning unable to go to sleep, he was to nervous for the training that would begin the next day. He finally got his nerves together and fell asleep only to be awoken by the sounds of a bugle blaring in the hallway a few minutes later. He got out of bed, washed up, and got dressed. “ All students starting the training today please make our way to the lobby.” The words came out of the speaker in the hallway. Arthur got his bag and headed for the door. When he opened it Katelyn was standing there waiting for him.
“Hey Katelyn you read to start the training”
“I am totally ready for this, let’s go!” They headed down the hallway to the elevator. Arthur was so tired he almost fell asleep on the elevator ride down to the lobby but Katelyn was there to keep him awake. They finally arrived at the lobby. There was less people there than there were the day before.
</p>
		<li>Chapter 8</li>
		<p>It was a small class, only about 32 people including Arthur and Katelyn. They joined the group and stood there and waited for their instructor. Finally 2 people in black robes came out and took off their hoods.
“Hello, I am your instructor Go-Mo and this is my assistant instructor Fay. As I can see not all of you have our cloaks yet. Your cloaks will be delivered to your rooms by the end of the day. Now let’s start the training. Today we will figure out what powers you possess and give you some exercise that you will do to start practicing your powers. Now we will divide you into two groups. One will go with me and the other will go with instructor Fay to the power rooms” said instructor Go-Mo. After they divided them up into 2 groups they headed to the power rooms. They went down many hallways until finally they got to a hallway which had many small doors labeled “Power rooms”. “Everybody step in front of a door! Now enter the room!” instructed Go-Mo. The rooms were small and had one small light hanging in the middle of them and the only other thing in there was a blanket on the floor. “Sit down on the blanket with your legs crossed and let your mind wander” arthur sat down on the blanket and closed his eyes and concentrated on opening his mind.  He sat there for a while with nothing happening, then he felt a surge in his head and his mini mind self got transported to a stone platform with some weird engraving. The sky or ground or whatever was all around him was a pinkish, purplish, orangish color. There were similar looking plattform next to him and also as far as he could see.
